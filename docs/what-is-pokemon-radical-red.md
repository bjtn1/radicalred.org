Pokémon Radical Red is an enhancement hack of Pokémon Fire Red created by [soupacell](https://twitter.com/soupacell?lang=en) and [koala4](https://www.pokecommunity.com/members/koala4.146484/) 

This is a difficulty hack, with massive additional features added to help you navigate through this game.

This hack utilises the [Complete Fire Red Upgrade Engine (CFRUE)](https://github.com/Skeli789/Complete-Fire-Red-Upgrade) and [Dynamic Pokemon Expansion (DPE)](https://github.com/Skeli789/Dynamic-Pokemon-Expansion) built by [Skeli789](https://github.com/Skeli789), [Ghoulslash](https://github.com/ghoulslash), and others. It's responsible for most of the significant features in the hack.

## List of features (most of them provided by CFRUE and DPE):
- Much higher difficulty, with optional modes to add or mitigate difficulty
- Built-in Randomizer options (Pokémon, Abilities and Learnsets)
