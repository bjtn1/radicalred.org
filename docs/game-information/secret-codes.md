## NES Cheat codes
| Code          | What it does | Requirements
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| `Woyaopp`     | Enables infinite Rare Candies for easy Level-Ups + Pomeg Berries for easy Happiness points. To obtain those, talk to the Youngster in the Viridian City grass patches near the Pokémon Center. | None |
| `SO2Toxic`    | Enables care packages, very useful when replaying the game. You’ll get free items for almost everything you’re allowed to receive/farm/thief up to that point by walking on certain tiles, including Raid Dens. Once the code is enabled, the packages cannot be avoided. While this is not the intended way of playing this hack, they are gigantic time savers if you’re doing a challenge run, such as a Monotype run or a Nuzlocke. | None |
| `DexAll`      | Allows your Dexnav to show all possible Pokémon in the route you are in, even when you haven’t registered them in your Pokédex by seeing them. | None |
| `TeamPreview` | Allows you to see the entire opposing Pokémon team at all times during a battle, rather than only the ones that have been revealed by the opponent so far. | None |
| `EZCatch`     | With this cheat activated, every Pokéball will have a 100% chance to catch any Pokémon. | None |


## Mystery Gift cheat codes

| `Random6` | Gives you six random pre-evolved Pokémon (an exception/mistake was made for Metapod and Kakuna) to build a team with. You cannot roll duplicates, except if you get the regional form of a Pokémon you already rolled. | New Game Plus                         |
| `Puzzle`  | Automatically completes the Puzzle Battles in Viridian City’s School (Pokévial) and Cerulean City (Move Relearner).                                                                                                    | New Game Plus                         |
| `Mega`    | Gives one of each Mega Stone, along with the power of Mega Evolving your Pokémon before even obtaining the Mega Ring.                                                                                                  | New Game Plus and 3 gym badges        |
