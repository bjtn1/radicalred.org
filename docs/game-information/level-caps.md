This hack limits the rate at which your Pokemon earn XP to prevent overleveling.

The hack offers two difficulty options: __Hardcore Mode__ and __Easy Mode__. Because of this, each difficulty's level caps differ slightly from one another at the beginning of the game.

Level caps are updated after certain milestones such as defeating certain trainers and obtaining a certain number of gym badges.

To avoid spoilers, some milestones will be intentionally vague
