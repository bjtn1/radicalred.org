This hack allows the user to select different options before their journey begins.

## Difficulty Options

### Normal (Default) mode
Normal mode is most appealing for most players, and is the way it was intended to be played

### Restricted mode
Restricted mode restricts certain abilities and moves from the player

### Hardcode mode
Hardcore mode restricts certain abilities and moves from the player, and bosses are even more powerful. 

This game mode is automatically paired with [minimal grinding mode](#minimal-grinding-mode) to make it less tedious. It isn't advised to attempt this on your first playthrough 

## Minimal grinding mode
Minimal Grinding Mode guarantees all pokemon have perfect IVs, and EVs cannot be obtained. 

Likewise, boss Pokemon will not have EVs either. This is for people who dislike EV training or grinding for perfect IVs

## Randomizer Options
### Normal species randomizer
Normal species randomizer randomizes encounters, trainer, and gifts. It does not randomize boss battles. Many legendaries cannot be encountered.

### Scaled species randomizer
Scaled species randomizer only gives reasonable Pokemon for where you are in the game.

You only see weak pokemon when you start, and they begin scaling when you receive more gym badges. 

It does not randomize boss battles

### Ability randomizer
Ability randomizer randomizes abilities for the player, but doesn't affect abilities on boss pokemon

### Learnset randomizer
Learnset randomizer randomizes Pokemon learnsets. It does not randomize TMs or move tutors. Boss pokemon also retain their normal movesets
